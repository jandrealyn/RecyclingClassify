# Recycling Classification App

This application was created for an assignment with Yoobee Colleges. 

The main purpose of the application is to take user uploaded images and classify them to see if they are recyclable or organic!

To use this application:

1. Clone the repository into you local drive

2. Open the application folder in PyCharm or an IDE that supports Flask/Python development

3. Run a virtual environment (if wanted) and install the required packages/libraries

4. Run the application from main.py

5. Enjoy! :)
